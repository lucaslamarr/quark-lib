ADDITIONAL NOTES

1. Zero external dependencies introduced (only what is included with the operating system).
2. Avoid additional includes for minimal code usage (write custom implementations rather than importing a whole header).
3. Pass parameters as pointers when incoming data is larger than 8 bytes.
4. Prefer standardized integers when possible.
5. Single layer use of ternary operator assignment (anything nested should become if/else statements or switch).
6. Elect for if/else statements over switches when able.
7. No function overloading (give everything descriptive names, no ambiguity).
8. Header file comments state what it does, C file comments says how it works.

Mark new header file sections like this...

/*-------------------------
---SECTION DECLARATIONS----
-------------------------*/

Mark new C file sections like this...

/*-------------------------
----SECTION DEFINITIONS----
-------------------------*/

This is easily searchable and identifiable by "SECTION + DECLARATIONS"
