--ADDITIONAL NOTES--
1. Zero dependencies introduced (only what is part of the base language, no C standard library either).
2. Pass parameters as pointers when incoming data is larger than 8 bytes.
3. Single layer use of ternary operator assignment (anything nested should become if/else statements or switch).
4. Header file comments state what it does, C file comments says how it works.
5. Mark new header file sections like this...

/*-------------------------
---SECTION DECLARATIONS----
-------------------------*/

Mark new C file sections like this...

/*-------------------------
----SECTION DEFINITIONS----
-------------------------*/

This is easily searchable and identifiable.
